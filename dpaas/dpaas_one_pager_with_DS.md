**Data Products as a Service (DPaaS) - One Pager**

*A Unified Consulting Offering to Deliver Business-Aligned, Reusable Data Solutions*

The Challenge
-------------

Organizations often engage multiple consulting teams---data engineering, governance, and analytics---without a unified strategy. This leads to misaligned priorities, duplicated work, fragmented KPIs, delayed insights, and underutilized tools.

Even well-intentioned data democratization efforts fail when they lack foundational data products that are reusable, governed, and aligned with business needs.

Our Solution: Data Products as a Service
----------------------------------------

DPaaS is a product-driven consulting model that combines cross-functional capabilities to deliver complete, business-aligned data products. We embed product thinking from day one to create trusted, reusable assets with governance and measurable business value.

Key Benefits:

- Trusted, reusable data products\
Self-service enablement\
Embedded governance and quality\
Reduced rework and increased time to value

How It Works
------------

Delivery team includes:

- Client SME / Product Owner -- aligns product to business vision\
Data Architect -- designs scalable, governed solutions\
Data Engineer -- builds data pipelines and models\
BI Developer -- creates dashboards and analytics\
Governance Lead -- embeds metadata, lineage, and quality controls

Ideal Use Cases
---------------

- Customer 360 dashboards\
Sales performance and forecasting\
ESG & regulatory reporting\
Finance or operations KPIs\
CRM/ERP migration-based rebuilds

Real-World Impact
-----------------

In a recent CRM migration project, three separate consulting teams (engineering, governance, and BI) worked independently. Misalignment led to rework and delivery delays. With DPaaS, a single cross-functional team could have delivered a unified reporting-ready product---faster, cleaner, and aligned from day one.
