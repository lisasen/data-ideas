# 🧾 One-Pager: Data Products as a Service (DPaaS)

## 🚀 Executive Summary

Organizations often turn to consulting partners for support in data engineering, analytics, or governance—but these efforts are typically siloed and deliver isolated outputs, not scalable outcomes.

**Data Products as a Service (DPaaS)** is a unified, product-led consulting model that aligns teams, reduces rework, and accelerates the delivery of trusted, reusable, and business-ready data assets.

> “DPaaS isn’t just a delivery model—it’s an accelerator for data trust, adoption, and reuse.”

## 📊 The Problem

- **60%** of self-service BI initiatives fail due to lack of trust in data (Gartner)  
- **70%** of rework comes from siloed delivery and unclear requirements  
- Fragmented ownership leads to delays, inconsistent KPIs, and missed business goals

---

## 🧩 What is DPaaS?

DPaaS is a consulting-led, cross-functional delivery model that builds **governed, reusable data products** aligned to business outcomes.

**Key Principles**:
- Product-oriented, not project-scoped
- Business SME at the center
- Embedded governance
- Self-service ready by design

| Traditional Consulting       | DPaaS                              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Disconnected workstreams    | Cross-functional product team       |
| Delivery by role            | Delivery by outcome                 |
| Ad hoc governance           | Governance built into the lifecycle |
| Repetitive builds           | Modular and reusable architecture   |
