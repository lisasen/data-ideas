Welcome to my Data Innovation Hub. I am Lisa a self-proclaimed Data Ninja with many years of hands on experience across the data landscape. I've worked in just about every facet of data you can imagine. My passion for data runs deep, infact I like to joke that at the end of the world, the quest for data will prevail. 

In this space I would share thoughts, insights and ideas on all things data. Whether you are a fellow data enthusiast or just curious, I hope to inspire you to think of data in a different lens.
